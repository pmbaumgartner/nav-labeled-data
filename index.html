    Natural Language Processing projects requiring supervised learning often face the challenge of obtaining sufficient, high-quality labeled data. In recent years, a variety of new data-centric methodologies have emerged to address various tasks within the standard supervised learning workflow. In this presentation we’ll cover this new set of tools by working through an example project, illustrating how new methods can help practitioners do more with their data. We’ll cover topics like sentence embeddings, submodular sampling, creating better annotation experiences, using inter-annotator agreement, few-shot learning, and confident learning – illustrating how these methods can improve the process of collecting high quality data.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects often depend on the availability and quality of labeled<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> data for supervised learning. Recently, the data-centric AI movement <span class="citation" data-cites="WhyItTime2023">(<a href="#ref-WhyItTime2023" role="doc-biblioref">Brown 2022</a>)</span> has emerged as a guiding philosophy that has has driven the development of new methods that address various tasks within the standard supervised learning workflow. This document aims to provide an overview of these new tools by working through an example project, illustrating how these methods can help practitioners improve their data collection process.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In machine learning, the verb <em>labeling</em> often refers to the process of adding some information to a piece of data, typically for classification-based supervised learning tasks. In linguistics, this process is sometimes referred to as <em>annotation</em>. In the social sciences, this is referred to as <em>coding</em>. In this document, I will interchangeably use the verbs <em>labeling</em> and <em>annotation</em> and nouns <em>labels</em> and <em>annotations</em>.</p></li></div></div>
<p>The primary goal is to illustrate a set of tools that and how they might work together in an NLP project. Though these methods are presented in the context of a “project”, depending on your context you may not use every method for every project. I will not be diving deep into the math or history of any method, but I will give general context on each one.</p>
<p>The success of applied NLP projects often depends on understanding the available tools and developing skill in connecting them together. In applied projects, it’s often best to iterate quickly by finding out what doesn’t work, understanding the constraints of your problem area, and making changes based on that information. Often applied projects don’t have perfect quality data, state-of-the-art models aren’t available, and there is a lack of labeled data and resources to label it. The tools presented here will help address these points.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="case-study">Case Study</h3>
<p>To help illustrate, we’ll be working through an example project using HappyDB <span class="citation" data-cites="asai2018happydb">(<a href="#ref-asai2018happydb" role="doc-biblioref">Asai et al. 2018</a>)</span> as a dataset. HappyDB is “a collection of happy moments described by individuals experiencing those moments.” It was collected via crowd-sourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk, where each worker was presented with the following task:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What made you happy today? Reflect on the past 24 hours, and recall three actual events that happened to you that made you happy. Write down your happy moment in a complete sentence. (Write three such moments.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the paper describing HappyDB, the authors perform several language related tasks on the corpus. For our purpose, we’ll focus on the classification task they describe and use it as a comparison throughout the process.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote page-columns page-full">
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>We developed a multi-class classifier using Logistic Regression with a bag of words representation of happy moments as features. To obtain training data, we crowd sourced a batch of 15,000 happy moments to obtain category labels. Every happy moment was shown to 5 workers, and we only considered labels that at least 3 workers agreed on. [<a href="#tbl-happy-db-10">Table&nbsp;1</a>] shows the performance of our classifier using a 5-fold cross-validation setup. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The HappyDB paper was released January 2018. The “Transformers revolution” didn’t start until October 2018 when the BERT paper was published. However, this paper was released when methods like word embeddings were available, so it’s unclear why they only apply a simple bag-of-words approach to classification.</p></li></div></div>

<p>We’ll start by familiarizing ourselves with this dataset. The text of a happy moment is contained in the <code>cleaned_hm</code> column, and the original classification in the <code>ground_truth_category</code> columns. While the authors provide over 100,000 examples in their dataset, we will filter the dataset down to the roughly 15,000 that were originally annotated by a human.</p>

<p>We’ll come back to the labels later. For now, let’s assume we’re starting a new project and we don’t have any labeled data. The first thing we would want to do with this dataset is some exploratory data analysis (EDA).</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="embedding-text" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-text">Embedding Text</h2>
<p>An common EDA process with text data is to split up the text by word (tokenization), remove common words that provide low-information (stopwords), count those words, and review the most common words that are left. That process works for getting aggregate information about your dataset at the word-level, but doesn’t provide any document-specific information about our texts. Instead of doing that process, we’re going to take a document-first approach and embed each of our texts.</p>
<p>We we <em>embed</em> a piece of text, we transform it into a fixed-size numerical vector that’s a <em>representation</em> of that text - and that representation is called an <em>embedding</em>. These embeddings capture semantic information about the text and enable us to do interesting comparisons between texts. Metaphorically we think of embeddings as assigning an address to each <em>thing</em> you’re embedding, such that <em>things</em> that are similar will have addresses next to each other.</p>
<p>Semantically meaningful embeddings were popoularized first at the word-level with the word2vec algorithm <span class="citation" data-cites="mikolov2013distributed">(<a href="#ref-mikolov2013distributed" role="doc-biblioref">Mikolov et al. 2013</a>)</span>. As an exmaple of the semantic information captured by word embeddings, it was found that they can be used to solve word analogy tasks like <code>King – Man + Woman = Queen</code>.</p>
<p>Since the invention of word embeddings, several approaches to generating document-level embeddings have been developed. Initially, we would use pre-trained word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText and average the embeddings of each word in a piece of text to create a document embedding. There was also an approach called doc2vec which created document-specific embeddings while training a model similar to word2vec. When transformers based models like BERT were originally created, similar approaches to averaging embeddings were used - though now the word embeddings were contextual and existed as a byproduct of the task those models were trained on. Today we have a set of pre-trained models trained specifically to generate useful embeddings based on sentence similarity tasks.</p>
<p>For our use case, we’ll use one of those pre-trained sentence embedding models from the <code>sentence-transformers</code> python library.</p>
<p>The amount of preprocessing you want to do will depend on your data, but it is important to make sure it’s consistent. For this case, we’ll simply lowercase all of the texts. One thing you do <strong>not</strong> want to do is remove stopwords or lemmatize. When using pre-trained models, you want your texts to be as close as possible to the training data used for those models.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Dimensionality reduction allows us to project the embeddings down to a reasonable number of dimensions so we can visualize the data and avoid the curse of dimensionality.

Around nine in the morning, we arrived at Jeti Mersing and my father parked his car at there. We take a bot at ten o'clock. Our journey from Jetty Mersing to Tioman Island is about one hour and thirty minute. Along travel to Tioman Island by bot, I saw many interesting scenery like a lot of monkey when our bot is near to the near Island and the water was very clean and clear blue in colour. Iam the one who was very excited to arrived at Tioman Island. At twelve noon, we safely arrived at Tioman Island. I was very excited. The scenery was very amazing with the birds flying anywhere just like to welcome us. It is so fascinating to be there. When we went out from the bot, have a car exactly like when we see when people playing a golf was waiting for us to take us to the resort.

The holidays are a good time to strengthen our connections and renew relationships. So turn off the cell phones, computers and televisions and take time to focus on your family.\r\n  Research shows that families who spend time together are strong families. They communicate better and share a sense of belonging. Here are a few ideas you can try to spend time with your family.\r\n     * Family game night. Spend at least one night during the holidays with the TV off and the family huddled together to play a favorite game. You may play cards, bingo or any other family favorite. Consider continuing this practice throughout the year and designate at least one night per week as family game night.\r\n     * Go for a walk. After eating rich holiday foods, taking a walk provides not only time together but a great way to get some exercise.\r\n     * Movie night. Rent a movie or watch a TV holiday special, pop some popcorn, and kick back for some family fun. Like game night, this may be something you'd like to continue throughout the year as a way to spend time together.\r\n     * Play outdoors together. You can ride bikes, play ball, or go for a hike. Itall give the entire family some fresh air, exercise and great fun.\r\n     * Go shopping. Hang out together while shopping at the after Christmas sales.\r\n      * Cook together. Parents and kids can do the holiday baking and food preparation together. Even the youngest children can wash vegetables, set the table, or ice cookies.\r\n     * Spend some one-on-one time with each child if you have more than one. Spending time alone provides time to bond with the child and helps him gain a sense of belonging and feeling of importance. It also provides an opportunity for the two of you to get to know each other better.\r\n     * Since grandparents and older family members usually visit during the holidays, take time to share family customs and tell stories about past generations. Families build strength when they share family customs and traditions give family members a sense of belonging, and they strengthen values and beliefs. \r\n     One of the greatest gifts of the holiday season is the gift of time with family. Spend time together to strengthen relationships and to make wonderful family memories. Strong families spend time with each other - quality time in large quantities. So begin during the holidays and continue making time for each other throughout the year."],["I met my old friends"],["After spending an hour on the first computer issue, I successfully completed another computer task after another hour's worth of work."],["My dearest friend has cleared her GRE exam with good score.

Joel will share his ideas and insights about lifehacking, building a business and working on company culture. Here is #1:\r\nToday itas a little over three years since I first had the idea for Buffer, and with the year and a half before that which I worked on my previous startup, Iave started to notice a few patterns amongst the ups and downs that come with building a startup.\r\nOne of the most important things Iave learned during this time is that I perform the best when Iam happy. It really does change everything. If Iam happy then Iam more productive when hacking code, Iam better at answering support, and I find it easier to stay focused.\r\nIave found that there are a few key habits which, for me, act as great rituals for enabling me to be consistently happy. They also act as anchor activities to bring my happiness level back up quickly whenever I have a period where Iam not feeling 100%. So here are 6 of the things I do:\r\n1. Wake up early\r\nOne of the things I love about running my own startup is that I have complete freedom to experiment with my daily routine.\r\nThrough experimentation, Iave found that waking up early every day makes me feel most invigorated and happy. It gives me a great start to the day, and this almost always leads to a great rest of the day. Over time, Iave found I crave that early morning feeling, a time I can do some great work and be super focused. Gretchen Rubin from The Happiness Project mentioned something similar a recent article:\r\naI get up at 6:00 a.m. every day, even on weekends and vacation, because I love it.a\r\nWaking up early every day requires discipline, especially about what time I sleep. Right now, I have a sleep ritual of disengaging from the day at 9:30pm and sleeping at 10pm. I now love all aspects of this ritual and with it in place I awake at 6am feeling fresh.\r\nThe power with your mornings is that you will have about 25,000 of them in your life, so thereas a lot of room to experiment.\r\n2. Exercise daily\r\naWe found that people who are more physically active have more pleasant-activated feelings than people who are less activea a Amanda Hyde\r\nIn the last three years, Iave gone from dabbling with exercise to it becoming something I do every weekday without fail. At first I had no idea what to do at the gym, so I asked my brother, whoas a personal trainer. I then went a few times with a good friend and soon I was hooked.\r\nOver time, I developed this into a daily ritual so strong that I feel a pull towards it, and by doing it consistently I feel fantastic and can more easily take on other challenges. I recently discovered that exercise is a keystone habit which paves the way for growth in all other areas. Iave also found that it helps me to get high quality sleep each night.\r\n3. Have a habit of disengagement\r\naThe richest, happiest and most productive lives are characterized by the ability to fully engage in the challenge at hand, but also to disengage periodically and seek renewal a Loehr and Schwarz, The Power of Full Engagement\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, a key way I am able to wake up at 6am is through my ritual of disengaging in the evening. I go for a walk at 9:30pm, along a route which Iave done many times before. Since the route is already decided and is the same every time, I am simply walking and doing nothing else.

Iave always been grateful to have them, and I know that Iam the badass I am today in large part because of them.\r\n\r\nMost people would consider themselves fortunate to have great parents. However, I ended up with the coolest grandparents ever, as well. My last living grandparent died more than 16 years ago, but I think of all of them often.\r\n\r\nBut I never had the opportunity to meet one of my grandparents. My dadas mom, Florence, died in 1979, six years before I was born. My grandpa George remarried shortly after my birth, and his second wife, a saintly, kind woman named Marie, became my grandma, and I loved her as much as all of my biological grandparents.\r\n\r\nIave often wondered about Grandma Florence though.\r\nShe was just fifty-seven years old when she died, and Iam ashamed to say that I donat remember if it was from ovarian cancer or cervical cancer. I think ovarian. Whatever the cause, she died way too young.\r\n\r\nBut just because I never met her doesnat mean that she hasnt had an impact on my life. She has probably impacted my life more than any other person who Iave never met. That might not make sense, but let me explain.\r\n\r\nI donat remember how old I was when I learned that Grandpa George had a wife, and my dad had a mom, who Iad never met. I suspect I was six or seven-years-old, but I donat remember learning that information for the first time. It seems like something I always knew, even though Iam sure it isnat.\r\n\r\nI remember seeing pictures of her, and once visiting her grave. My sisteras middle name is Florence, and I knew why.\r\n\r\nThe earliest impact that I recall Grandma Florence having on my life came one rainy night when I was nine or ten-years-old. My dad, my two sisters and I were in the car and joking around. I donat remember what we were talking about, but at some point the conversation turned to wishes. If we could have just one wish, what would it be?\r\n\r\nIam sure my sisters and I wished for common kid stuff: a million dollars, school to be canceled, a TV in my room. Real dumb stuff to waste a wish on.\r\n\r\nAnd then we asked my dad what head wish for. And he said, aI wish my mom was still alive so she could meet you guys and see how proud I am of you.a\r\n\r\nHoly cow.\r\n\r\nThe joking atmosphere in the car immediately became more somber, and I donat remember if any of us said anything. But I remember thinking to myself, aHe sure must love us if heas going to use his one wish for that.a\r\n\r\nI knew he loved us. Despite his occasional moodiness, none of us ever questioned that we were the most important part of his life. He and my mom told us they loved us often, and that they were glad to have us. But his wish just seemed to kick things up a notch.\r\n\r\nSince that night, whenever I think of Grandma Florence I think of that conversation in the car, and Iam reminded once again just how much my parents love us. And that never ending, unconditional love has provided so much support for me over the years that I have no doubt itas the foundation of every single positive thing I do in my life.\r\n\r\nI think itas also the reason that I feel such a devotion to my kids and to my wife. I know how it feels to never have to wonder if anyone loves you completely and unconditionally. Iave known that all my life. And I want them to know it, also. I never want them to wonder if thereas anyone who loves them so completely.\r\n\r\nIn sixty-two days, on August 10, it will be the 100th anniversary of Grandma Florenceas birth. I donat know if anyone else has plans to celebrate it, but in my house well get an ice cream cake, and well sing Happy Birthday. And Iall tell my kids the few things I know about Grandma Florence, and Iall tell them the story of that night in the car.\r\n\r\nAnd Iall do my best to make them feel as loved as I did when I heard my dadas wish."],["Waking up this morning from an amazing dream had me in a great mood.

It was a lovely wedding very unlike any wedding Iave yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashersa| never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they werenat invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousinas face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  Heas still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  Iave been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasnat there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception.\r\n\r\nYou may recall that the groomas parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didnt go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.\r\n\r\nBut all of my aunts and uncles went, and I have a lot of aunts and uncles. It was funny to see all my uncles and my cousin and the characteristic ears of that side of the family.  The family resemblance is especially strong with military haircuts.  All my uncles are ex-military and they bonded with my cousinas army buddies.  Not much has changed in the army in the past 30-40 years.  SNAFUs still abound.  My aunts talked about how the world has changed and wondered if the homophobic father of the groom realized his favorite aunt (after whom one of his daughters is named) was a lesbian.  How nice it would have been if shead been around today and been able to share her relationship with her acompaniona out in the open.\r\n\r\nThey openly wondered what had happened to my unclea head always been rigid and never had a sense of humor, but wasnat such a hater until he married his wife.  Perhaps he could have been rigid and humorless for the powers of good if head married someone else.  Ironically, the woman he married and is refusing to countenance this wedding is a divorced mother of three| but the difference is that she got the Pope to annul that marriage, so somehow that made it ok.  There was some speculation that perhaps the bride is better off with her mother-in-law not talking to her.\r\n\r\nMy childless aunt and uncle took over duties of parents of the groom. The groom gave an especially moving speech about how grateful he was for his family to come and show the support they were showing.  The bride sent a lovely thank-you note with the same sentiments.  As the wedding party was breaking up for the folks having to catch planes, the bride and groom made plans to visit all of my aunts and uncles who live in interesting and accessible places.  My family does take care of its own, even when some members refuse to.\r\n\r\nMy cousin and his new wife are very nice people.  I know they will have a lifetime of happiness together.  And if their children and step-children are close with their great-aunts and uncles rather than their grandparents on my side of the family, well, that's not such a bad thing."],["It made me happy to eat many sweets tonight."],["MY FAMILY VISITED TO ARIYAMAN BEACH NEAR RAMANATHAPURAM"],["it's a small world events...

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="submodular-selection">Submodular Selection</h2>
<p>How do we understand this dataset and the diversity contained within it? How would we select a dataset for training a model? If we randomly sample, we’re beholden to the distribution of examples that exists in the training data: maybe 80% of the data is from a single topic, and 20% is from scattered topics. If we wanted to summarize the diversity of topics within the data, a random sample wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>Submodular sampling (optimization) is a way around this. We’ll use the <a href="https://github.com/jmschrei/apricot"><code>apricot</code></a> package which is self-described as a tool for the purpose of “summarizing massive data sets into minimally redundant subsets that are still representative of the original data.”</p>
<p>We’re going to use an algorithm called Facility Location and there’s some intuition behind this name. Let’s say we’re a restaurant owner and a city has given us permission to place 5 restaurant locations around the city. We would want to place them in a way that we’re able to serve the most customers without being redundant with our locations (assuming customers will always prefer to the nearest location and our locations have infinite capacity). If we know the locations of our customers, the Facility Location algorithm will give us an optimal placement of restaurants that reduces redundancy and maximizes the coverage of possible customers of our restaurants.</p>
<p>One important note is that it’s usually easier and more computationally efficient to run submodular sampling on lower-dimensional data. We’ll be running this algorithm on the output of t-SNE and not the full 382-dimension embeddings.</p>

<p>Imagine we are starting with this dataset and we want to annotate it into one of the six categories from the paper: <em>achievement, affection, bonding, enjoy the moment, exercise, leisure, nature</em>. We now need to think about the experience of those doing the annotation as well as their efficiency.</p>
<p>One easy efficiency gain would be to group the examples by similarity, so that an annotator isn’t jumping from topic to topic as they go through the examples. We can do with with TSNE by projecting down to one dimension and sorting on that dimension.</p>

<section id="correction-label-ordering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correction-label-ordering">Correction &amp; Label Ordering</h3>
<p>When annotating data, it’s important to consider how the <em>task</em> is presented and framed to the annotator. One way to make annotation more efficient is to reframe the task as correction-oriented process rather than a “blank slate” decision-making process. With binary tasks, this can involve presenting the annotator with a pre-made decision and asking for their approval or correction. For tasks multi-class/choice tasks, the strategy can be refined further. Instead of having the annotator choose from a fixed, consistently ordered list of labels, the set of of label options can be dynamically sorted and narrowed down to a subset of most relevant labels.</p>
<p>As an example, we took a similar approach for labeling offense descriptions from criminal justice data systems into one of 75 categories. In our approach, we initially present the annotator with the top 5 categories as predicted by a machine learning model, ordered by predicted probability. In 80% of instances, annotators selected one of these top 5 predicted categories. If a text can’t be assigned one of the 5 categories presented, it gets funneled into a dataset to be labeled with the full set of labels. This two-stage process streamlines the annotation process and enhances its efficiency.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to do this correction and label ordering task in practice:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Unsupervised</strong> - Create embeddings for all of your labels. For each input text, find the similarity between that input and each of your labels. Sort the labels by similarity.</li>
<li><strong>Supervised</strong> - If you have already trained a model on data, use the predictions from that model to pre-select an option for classificatoin.</li>
<li><strong>Weakly Supervised / Rules-Based</strong> - Use a set of rules to define how an example should be labeled a priori.</li>
<li><strong>LLMs</strong> - Use a LLM to make an initial label decision or ordering (see <a href="https://github.com/explosion/prodigy-openai-recipes">Prodigy OpenAI recipes</a>)</li>
</ol>

<section id="multiple-annotators-inter-annotator-agreement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multiple-annotators-inter-annotator-agreement">Multiple Annotators / Inter-Annotator Agreement</h2>
<p>Employing multiple annotators is a great way to get feedback on your annotation task and prevent downstream issues with an underspecified task.</p>
<p>Having multiple annotators provides varied perspectives on your annotation task. Having several annotators working in parallel provides an opportunity to identify areas of ambiguity or confusion in the labels, which can then be addressed proactively. This process leads to more precise and detailed labels, enhancing the performance of the supervised learning models trained on this data.</p>
<p>The use of multiple annotators also allows for the calculation of inter-annotator agreement measures, which can provide crucial insights into the quality of the annotation process and can be predcitive of machine learning model performance. High inter-annotator agreement suggests clear, well-defined labels and instructions, while low agreement may signal the need for further refinement of the annotation guidelines or training.</p>
<p>Many projects and datasets do employ multiple annotators, but do not provide individual annotator decisions (including HappyDB). Including such data when available can add an additional layer of transparency and accountability to the annotation process, and it also makes your data avaialable to be used in newer models that incorporate multiple annotations.</p>

<section id="few-shot-learning-w-setfit" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="few-shot-learning-w-setfit">Few Shot Learning w/ SetFit</h2>
<p>Ideal scenario: you have a bunch of training data - thousands of examples! At least 100 per category! You’ve got a state-of-the-art Transformer model ready to run on your GPU server cluster and you’re ready to get 100% accuracy!</p>
<p>We’re almost never in the idea scenario. What about models for little data? What about the scenario where we don’t have a GPU?</p>
<p>SetFit is a Few-Shot machine learning methodology <span class="citation" data-cites="tunstall2022efficient">(<a href="#ref-tunstall2022efficient" role="doc-biblioref">Tunstall et al. 2022</a>)</span> that takes advantage of existing embedding models from <code>sentence-transformers</code> that works well in situations with small amounts of training data.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>To understand how SetFit works, we need to first understand a bit about the training data and the loss function used for embedding models. These models are trained on pairs of sentences where the “target” value is the similarity between the two sentences.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For more details, see the relevant model cards, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2#fine-tuning">all-MiniLM-L12-v2</a>.</p></li></div></div>
<p>We can convert any single-text classification task into a paired classification task with some clever pre-processing: simply randomly sample pairs of sentences from a training dataset, and if they have the same category assign them to have a similarity of 1, and assign them a similarity of 0 if they’re from different classes.</p>
<p>After you do this process to get a paired similarity dataset, you can fine-tune any existing embeddings. I like to imagine this process as “stretching out” the embedding space so that texts from different labels will now be further apart.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Once you fine-tune your embeddings, you can then use those new embeddings as features and put any exising classification model, like logistic regression on top of that. This is usually called the ‘head’ of the model.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;A terminology note: doing this process without fine-tuning the embeddings is often called ‘linear probe’ in the literature. This is also a good baseline approach if you do not want to fine-tune.</p></li></div></div>
<p>Below we’ll train a SetFit model on our 100 examples selected with submodular selection, and we’ll evaluate the performance on the remainder of the dataset.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="correcting-labels-with-confident-learning">Correcting Labels with Confident Learning</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine our annotation campaign is over and we have our full, annotated dataset. It’s likely we made some mistakes annotating along the way. Confident learning <span class="citation" data-cites="northcutt2021confidentlearning">(<a href="#ref-northcutt2021confidentlearning" role="doc-biblioref">Northcutt, Jiang, and Chuang 2021</a>)</span> presents an approach to identify potential label errors in datasets. The <a href="https://github.com/cleanlab/cleanlab"><code>cleanlab</code></a> package provides several tools for doing this process.</p>
<p>In order to do confident learning you need two things: a labeled dataset and a predictive model to generate out-of-sample predicted probabilities for each example. Typically this is done similar to cross-validation where you train on one set of your data and predict on another. We’ll do 5-fold cross validation.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>It will be helpful to have a model that can train quickly, since we have to train 5 instances of it. We’ll choose a <code>FastText</code> model, which uses word and sub-word embeddings, and then use the average of a documents word embeddings as a document’s feature set to classify thsoe documents <span class="citation" data-cites="joulin2016bag">(<a href="#ref-joulin2016bag" role="doc-biblioref">Joulin et al. 2016</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn6"><p><sup>6</sup>&nbsp;<code>FastText</code> is also a good baseline choice and is particularly effective if your texts have inconsistency in spelling.</p></li></div></div>

    learning often face the challenge of obtaining sufficient,
    high-quality labeled data. In recent years, a variety of new
    data-centric methodologies have emerged to address various tasks
    within the standard supervised learning workflow. In this
    presentation we’ll cover this new set of tools by working through an
    example project, illustrating how new methods can help practitioners
    do more with their data. We’ll cover topics like sentence
    embeddings, submodular sampling, creating better annotation
    experiences, using inter-annotator agreement, few-shot learning, and
    confident learning -\/- illustrating how these methods can improve
    the process of collecting high quality data.}
